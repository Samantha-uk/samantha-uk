I'm Smanth, a critical care nurse based in Brighton (UK); before I entered nursing, I spent 27 years as an IT geek; from IT to ITU one might say ... but it seems that geek is in my DNA.

I started to ... dabble ... with coding again mid 2020; And it is fun!
Primary focus is on audio related projects (MIDI Control/Multi-FX/LV2)
