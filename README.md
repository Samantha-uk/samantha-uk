I'm Sam, a cardiology research nurse on the south coast of the UK; before I entered nursing, I spent 27 years as an IT geek ... and it seems that geek is in my DNA.

I started to ... dabble ... with coding again mid 2020; And it is fun!
Primary focus is on audio related projects (MIDI Control/Multi-FX/LV2) to facilitate my bass playing.
