Hi!


I am Sam.


After teaching myself BASIC and then pascal I moved onto C and then I fell in love with OOP and C++.

In the 80s I began a degree in medicine, 3 years in and I realised it was not for me so I left uni to become a professional coder; over the next 27 years I advanced in the field.

In 2015 I retrained as a nurse (_IT did not feed my heart_) and currently work as a cardiology research nurse on the south coast of the UK.

But geek is in my DNA.

I still dabble with h/w and s/w development.

My focus at present is on audio related projects (MIDI Control/Multi-FX/LV2) to facilitate my bass playing.
